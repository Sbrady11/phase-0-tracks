# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	- Version control is how we keep our code and changes organized into different iterations and 'versions', maintaining a safe 'master' before merging together for a final product. It's useful in that we can see changes over time, and keep a copy safe in case one of the changes was not correct. And this is a change to one!
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	- A branch is a carbon copy of the master, and allows us to make edits without interfering with the main version. It allows for easy changes without fear of corrupting the original document/file/code. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	- A commit is a 'save point', adding a new piece of information to the file. A good commit message notes the precise changes.
* What is a merge conflict?
	- According to git-tower.com, it is the instance in which Git is unable to tell which version is correct. In other words, if the same file is modified by two colleagues, such as in their example, in which one edits the same file, while the other deletes it, and both attempt to merge. Git won't know what to do, and will require direction.
