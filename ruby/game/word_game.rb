# Word Game Pseudo-Code

# Take in a secret word
# Initialize the guess count
# 	Maximum guesses equals string length
# Hide the word from player 2
# 	Split the word, take the .length of the word, print '_' characters in the stead of each hidden letter
# Player enters a character
# Computer checks character against secret word string
# If the character appears, the appropriate '_' is replaced with the character at the correct index
# 	Repeated characters do not count against the player
# Else
# 	The guess count increases by one
# Repeat until the word is chosen or the player runs out of guesses
# Word will be revealed regardless
# Much fun will be had
